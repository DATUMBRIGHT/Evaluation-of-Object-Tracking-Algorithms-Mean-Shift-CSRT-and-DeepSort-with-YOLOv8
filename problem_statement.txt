In this project, your task is to explore the following two computer vision applications. 
(i) Structure from Motion (SfM) and  
(ii) Object Tracking.  
Note that your grade will depend on the extent of the analysis and just completing the 
requirements outlined here fully will get you 90% of the total credits. Work in a group of two 
and your teammate should be different from previous group assignments. 
 
Report: Structure your report as below: 
1. Introduction. 
2. Part I: SfM 
a. Methods. Discuss one of the methods from each application step by step 
with code snippet. 
b. Experiments and Results 
c. Discussion 
3. Part II: Object Tracking 
a. Methods. Discuss one of the methods from each application step by step 
with code snippet. 
b. Experiments and Results (include evaluation) 
c. Discussion 
4. Conclusion 
 
 
Code: Write code in jupyter notebook and submit both the notebook and pdf export. 
 
Structure from Motion 
---------------------------- 
Set camera in auto-focus mode. Do experiments for the following. 
Algorithms: 
1. Sequential adjustment 
2. Bundle adjustment 
 
Experiments: 
1. Indoor and outdoor objects.  
2. Objects close and far 
3. Vary the number of views 
 
 
Object Tracking 
-------------------- 
Algorithms: 
i. Mean Shift or CamShift 
ii. CSRT or KCF 
iii. SORT or DeepSort 
 
Experiments: 
i. Moving camera with static object 
ii. Moving camera with moving object 
iii. Static camera with moving object 
iv. Try with varying object velocity. You can skip frame to try vary the speed.
